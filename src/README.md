Welcome to Atari Airlock, a retro game where you help a hero escape a sinking submarine filled with sea monsters. Use arrow keys to move left/right, jump with the up arrow, and collect coins for points. Grab keys to unlock the elevator and progress to the next level. Avoid monsters to stay alive. Developed by Pedro Lunet, António Cunha, and Allan Ferreira for LDTS 2023⁄24. Good luck!
